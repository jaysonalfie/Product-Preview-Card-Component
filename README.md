## My process
I was able to use React together with Vite to create the webpage and delved more into the mobile first approach as I was trying to achieve responsivity.This was an upgrade from using CRA that I was using before. I created a page component and Vanilla css was used for styling of the component.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Code bundler
